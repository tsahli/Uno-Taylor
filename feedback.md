10% - Java Project setup (no specific IDE, just so that it runs)

```diff
- Setup was simple
```

10% - .jar file inclusion (instead of copying/pasting classes), packaging as an executable .jar file for submission

```diff
+ No .jar was included (because no JSON was used) - -1 (would be -5 for other reasons, but -1 because no JSON)
- No build .jar file was submitted - -5
```

10% - Network/Server connection and communication with other clients

```diff
- This is partially working - communication with the shared clients is successful, but not the
-     clients that followed the API requirements for the server itself. There's also no chat
-     functionality. - -5
```

 5% - git / connection to GitHub
 
```diff
+ Connected to GitHub, commits are pushed
```

 5% - frequent commits (pertaining to code changes, not time)
 
```diff
+ Appropriate commits, messages aren't bad
- You don't need to put "updated" at the beginning of commit messages. Most of the commits you'll
-     find (or commit style guides) will say something similar to the gist at
-     https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53
+ Take some time learning good commit style and looking over projects with good commit structure and messages
```

35% - completion (how much of the game you can play)

```diff
- I'm more satisfied with the version demoed than what was submitted, so I'm grading functionality
-     on that. I know that there was a disconnect between what the group did and what you understood,
-     so I am grading based on your previous understanding.
- Gameplay is basically complete, there are some issues with display - -2
- Couldn't connect (as above), which means chat is not complete. It also means that completion
-     of JSONObjects (required as per the project description) isn't complete - -2
```

25% - Usability / Code standards / best practices / error & exception handling

```diff
- This is still better than _no_ GUI support, and I see you moved in the right direction, but the best play version
-     is not there, yet - -2
- Some variables with greater scope/accessible from greater scope - -1
- Unused variable - -1
- line 112 - String comparison with '=='
```

```diff
83%
